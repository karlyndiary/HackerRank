Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000. Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand (&) character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime numbers <=  would be:

2&3&5&7

WITH RECURSIVE Numbers AS (
    SELECT 2 AS num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num + 1 FROM Numbers WHERE num < 1000
),
Primes AS (
    SELECT n.num AS prime
    FROM Numbers AS n
    LEFT JOIN Numbers AS d ON d.num < n.num AND n.num % d.num = 0
    WHERE d.num IS NULL
)
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(prime ORDER BY prime SEPARATOR '&')
FROM Primes;

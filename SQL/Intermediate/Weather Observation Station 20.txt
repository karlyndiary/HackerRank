A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:
| Field  | Type     |
|--------|----------|
| ID     | NUMBER   |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2 |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2 |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER   |
| LONG_W | NUMBER   |

WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT LAT_N,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS ROWASC,
    COUNT(*) OVER () AS TOTAL_ROWS
    FROM STATION
    )

SELECT ROUND(AVG(LAT_N),4) AS MEDIAN
FROM CTE
WHERE ROWASC IN (
    (TOTAL_ROWS + 1)/2, 
    (TOTAL_ROWS + 2)/2)
